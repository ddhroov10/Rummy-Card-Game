# Indian Rummy Variation- Pool Rummy
Card Game made in Python
How is Point Rummy played:
-It's a 104 card game for 2 players with 4 jokers(Here- 1 joker)
-Players play for score which have a pre-decided value.(Here-same as face value of card)
-Each player is dealt a set of 13 cards randomly.
-First card from the pack is placed in the open deck indicating that the game has started.
-Remaining cards are placed face-down in the closed deck slot.
-In this variation if a single card is being used to make two sets or runs, it's considered valid
Objective : 
Arrange all 13 cards in-hand in sequences and/or sets(if required).
Each player takes turns to pick/discard a card from closed/open deck to complete sets and/or sequences.
.You can declare if you think it's a valid declare.
To declare the player must show the cards in hand by grouping them in sets/sequences and clicking on 'Declare' button.
Compulsory: To finish the game, you must declare at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence.

 In a vaild declare you must have minimum two runs. Examples of two Runs that meet the basic requirements are
a. If both the required runs are pure runs(cards of same suit), one of the runs must have minimum 4 cards. For example: 10-J-Q  and 4-5-6-7.
b. If one run is pure run and the other is non pure run(cards of same suit and a joker), one of runs must have minimum 4 cards. For example: 8-9-10 and J-Q-K-Joker; 8-9-10-J and Q-Joker-A.
